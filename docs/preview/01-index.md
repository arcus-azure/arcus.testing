# Introduction
Welcome to the Arcus Testing site! üéâ

## What is Arcus Testing?
Arcus Testing is an umbrella term for a set of NuGet packages `Arcus.Testing.*` that help with the creation, maintenance, and defect localization of code testing.

> üéñÔ∏è Specifically designed to help with integration testing against Azure resources, but also helps with tech-independent infrastructure.

In short: Arcus Testing is a set of libraries that makes tests more fun to write!

## Why should I use Arcus Testing?
Testing is a fact of life. Writing those tests often comes with an effort to set up a test code infrastructure to interact with all the parts of the system.

Arcus Testing lessens the burden of re-creating the same boilerplate test code infrastructure for similar projects.

## How to use Arcus Testing?
